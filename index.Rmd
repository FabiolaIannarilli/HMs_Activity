# Preface {#preface}

This vignette accompanies the manuscript @Iannarilliea2024 and contains step-by-step examples on how to use trigonometric and cyclic regression spline Generalized Linear Mixed Models (GLMMs) for the analysis of activity patterns from camera-trap data (chapter \@ref(trig) and chapter \@ref(cyclic), respectively). It also includes examples of comparing the importance of different covariates when fitting GLMMs to describe activity patterns \@ref(compcovs), and additional resources to illustrate the difference between conditional and marginal mean activity patterns \@ref(condvsmarg) and the application of Kernel Density Estimators through the packages currently available in R \@ref(kdes).

All the analyses presented in the following sections were created in @R. The camera-trap data used in the real-case examples can be accessed at XXXX. Details on how this data have been collected can be found in @Iannarilliea2020.
