# Preface {#preface}

This vignette accompanies the manuscript @Iannarilliea2024 and contains step-by-step examples on how to use trigonometric and cyclic cubic spline Hierarchical Models (HMs) to analyze activity patterns from time-stamped camera-trap data (sections \@ref(est), \@ref(unibim)). It also includes examples of comparing the importance of different covariates when fitting GLMMs to describe activity patterns (section \@ref(cat)), and additional resources to illustrate the difference between conditional and marginal mean activity patterns (section \@ref(condvsmarg)) and the application of Kernel Density Estimators through the packages currently available in R (section \@ref(kdes)).

All the analyses presented in the following sections were performed in @R-base. The camera-trap data used in the real-case examples can be accessed at XXXX. Details on how this data were collected can be found in @Iannarilliea2021.
